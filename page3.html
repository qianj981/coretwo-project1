            <p>The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. 
A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the 
breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of 
other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, 
streams, or the West wind.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an 
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. 
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: 
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had 
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there 
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The 
stuttering sparks of the music kept on. 
</p>
            <p>But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a 
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by 
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the 
moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. </p>
            <br>
            <p>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. </p>
<br>
<br>
            <p>"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. 
No doubt you want to see the garden?" </p>
<br>
            <p>Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.  </p>
<br>
            <p>"The garden?" </p>
            <br>
            <p>"The garden of forking paths." </p>
            <br>
            <p>Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:  </p>
            <br>
            <p>"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in." </p>
            <br>
            <p>The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, 
we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some 
large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was 
edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never been 
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also 
a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which 
our potters copied from the Persians . . .</p>
            <br>
            <p>Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, 
remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. 
There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later, he  </p>
